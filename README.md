## Project Description

This SPA [single page application] is a dynamic public calendar that allows users to view details regarding upcoming community events as well as to create and post their own events for others to view and attend.

The page displays thumbnails of user-generated events which, when clicked, will display a modal box containing pertinent event information such as date, time, location, and a brief description of the event, itself. Users can then confirm their attendance by selecting the appropriate option from a drop-down select menu.

The main page also features a "create event" button that opens a form modal into which users are able to input information regarding a new event they wish to publicize. Users will be prompted to enter the aforementioned specifics of the event such as date, time, and location. Upon submission, a new event thumbnail will be generated and appended to the events calendar homepage.
